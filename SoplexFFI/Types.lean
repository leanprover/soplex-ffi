/-
  Data types shared by the certificate checker (`Soplex.Verify`) and
  the FFI binding (`Soplex.Basic`).

  Lives inside the `Verify` namespace because the verifier is the
  standalone library; the FFI side imports these types and reuses them
  unchanged. Pure-Lean only — no dependency on the FFI.

  This file states the shared API types; the verifier and FFI layers
  both import these definitions.

    Sparse `a` entries are `(row, col, value)`, with row and column
    indices carrying their bounds in the type. `validate` normalises
    this representation: duplicate `(row, col)` entries are summed, zero
    values are dropped, entries are sorted by `(row, col)`. The verifier

    (`m` rows, `n` cols); a coordinate is zero whenever the matching
    bound is `none`. The *signed* dual would be `rowLower − rowUpper`
    (and similarly for columns), but storing the split is strictly more
    expressive for ranged constraints, where the dual objective genuinely

/-- Certificate of the solve outcome.

    Which fields are required depends on `status`:

    * `optimal`     — `primal` and `dual`
    * `infeasible`  — `dual` (a Farkas multiplier)
    * `unbounded`   — `primal` (a feasible base point) and `ray`
    * anything else — none required

    The verifier checks the appropriate combination and accepts /
    rejects accordingly.

    Parameterised by `(m n : Nat)` — the constraint and variable
    counts — so the primal / ray vectors and the dual bundle all
    carry their expected lengths in the type. -/
